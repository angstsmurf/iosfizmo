<h1>How to Play</h1>

<p>
In this game, you are the center of a story. You will type commands
in simple English; the game will respond, and tell you what happens.
</p>

<p>
What commands does this game understand? Well, it depends on the game.
You can try nearly anything you can think of, if it makes sense in the
situation you find yourself in.
</p>

<p>
Most interactive fiction follows some simple rules, though. Once you&#x2019;re
familiar with the pattern and the common commands, you can explore freely,
and you&#x2019;ll have a good idea how to experiment further.
</p>

<h2>What commands look like</h2>

<p>
The simplest IF commands are usually one or two words:
</p>

<ul class="CommandList">
<li>LOOK
<li>TAKE SWORD
<li>EAT CUPCAKE
<li>PUSH BUTTON
</ul>

<p>
But sometimes you need more:
</p>

<ul class="CommandList">
<li>LOOK UNDER BED
<li>PUT LETTER IN ENVELOPE
</ul>

<p>
In a more complicated scene, you might have to get more specific:
</p>

<ul class="CommandList">
<li>EAT THE SMALL BLUE JELLYBEAN
<li>PUT COPPER COIN IN SLOT 4
</ul>

<p>
You will almost always be dealing with concrete things that you see in
the game world. Work with what you see around you. If you try wild 
abstractions like 
&#x201C;<span class="Command">GO SEE A MOVIE</span>&#x201D; or 
&#x201C;<span class="Command">RUN FOR PRESIDENT</span>&#x201D;, the game will probably not
understand you.
</p>

<h2>Orienting yourself</h2>

<p>
If you are completely at sea, you can always try these commands:
</p>

<ul class="CommandList">
<li>LOOK
<span class="Gloss">or</span>
L
<span class="Gloss">: Look around the room &#x2014; repeat the description of
everything you see.</span>
<li>INVENTORY
<span class="Gloss">or</span>
I
<span class="Gloss">: List everything you&#x2019;re carrying.</span>
<li>EXAMINE <span class="Term">thing</span>
<span class="Gloss">or</span>
X <span class="Term">thing</span>
<span class="Gloss">: Look more closely at something &#x2014; learn more about
it.</span>
</ul>

<p>
Because these actions are so common, they have one-letter
abbreviations: 
&#x201C;<span class="Command">L</span>&#x201D;,
&#x201C;<span class="Command">I</span>&#x201D;, and
&#x201C;<span class="Command">X</span>&#x201D;.
</p>

<p>
Again, your actions should focus on the objects and exits that you see
in the game world.
</p>

<h2>Moving around the world</h2>

<p>
The game world is divided into locations &#x2014; usually called 
&#x201C;rooms&#x201D;, although
they might be indoors or outdoors. A room is everything you can see at
one time, and everything you can conveniently reach. Don&#x2019;t worry about
crossing the room, turning around, or standing near things; that sort of
movement is automatic.
</p>

<p>
To move to a <em>different</em> location, you&#x2019;ll usually type simple compass
directions:
</p>

<ul class="CommandList">
<li>NORTH
<li>SOUTH
<li>EAST
<li>WEST
<li>NORTHEAST
<li>SOUTHWEST
<li>UP
<li>DOWN
</ul>

<p>
You can abbreviate these directions as
&#x201C;<span class="Command">N</span>&#x201D;,
&#x201C;<span class="Command">NE</span>&#x201D;, and so on; also
&#x201C;<span class="Command">U</span>&#x201D; and
&#x201C;<span class="Command">D</span>&#x201D;.
</p>

<p>
More specific commands sometimes make sense:
</p>

<ul class="CommandList">
<li>IN
<li>OUT
<li>ENTER BANK VAULT
<li>GO THROUGH ARCHWAY
<li>CLIMB LADDER
</ul>

<h2>Common actions</h2>

<p>
You&#x2019;re probably staring at your dictionary and shuddering in terror
(or anticipation!) of the infinite possibilities. Sometimes IF works
that way. More often, you&#x2019;ll run through a small list of common
commands &#x2014; some of which you&#x2019;ve already seen.
</p>

<ul class="CommandList">
<li>EXAMINE <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>GET <span class="Term">thing,</span>
DROP <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>PUT <span class="Term">this</span> IN <span class="Term">that,</span>
PUT <span class="Term">this</span> ON <span class="Term">that</span>
<li>PUSH <span class="Term">thing,</span>
PULL <span class="Term">thing,</span>
TURN <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>OPEN <span class="Term">thing,</span>
CLOSE <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>LOCK <span class="Term">this</span> WITH <span class="Term">that,</span>
UNLOCK <span class="Term">this</span> WITH <span class="Term">that</span>
<li>TOUCH <span class="Term">thing,</span>
SMELL <span class="Term">thing,</span>
LISTEN TO <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>EAT <span class="Term">thing,</span>
DRINK <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>WEAR <span class="Term">thing,</span>
REMOVE <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>SEARCH <span class="Term">thing,</span>
LOOK IN <span class="Term">thing,</span>
LOOK UNDER <span class="Term">thing,</span>
LOOK BEHIND <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>ENTER <span class="Term">thing,</span>
SIT ON <span class="Term">thing,</span>
CLIMB <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>GET IN <span class="Term">thing,</span>
GET OFF <span class="Term">thing,</span>
GET OUT OF <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>BREAK <span class="Term">thing,</span>
CUT <span class="Term">thing,</span>
CRUSH <span class="Term">thing</span>
<li>WAIT
</ul>
